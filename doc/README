This can serve as a start point to create an Open Data Node. What
needs to be done to make it so:

a) svn cp <...>/benchmark/trunk <...>/OpenDataNode/trunk

b) transform SesameBenchmark into something like container or whatever
   (maybe even using OSGI) so that it loads and runs Harvester
   and other components (as sort of plug-ins)

   i) at first, we need to only split the code into appropriate
      classes and packages, all in one project

   ii) later we can thing about making it configurable so that ODN
       can be deployed in varying configurations (like somebody does
       not need certain harvesters and APIs so there would be a way to
       configure and deploy ODN to meet that criteria)

c) transform existing Python proof-of-concept harvesters
   into Java (maybe by running them in Jython or if feasible, rewriting
   then into Java)

d) enhancing the Datanest CSV harvesters to be able to "re-run"
   and process only differences - i.e. we need to make them able to
   keep ODN copy of data up-to-date with Datanest "original"

e) adding more harvesters: direct harvesting of ORSR to get more data
   about companies, direct harvesting of procurement portals to have
   a shot by getting more data from the scanned documents themselves, ...

f) ...
